# Route Warnings Fix Summary

## âœ… Issue Resolved

### Problem:

```
WARN  Route "./(tabs)/explore.tsx" is missing the required default export
WARN  Route "./(tabs)/explore2.tsx" is missing the required default export
```

### Root Cause:

-   Two empty TypeScript files existed in the `app/(tabs)/` directory
-   These files were not referenced in the tab layout configuration
-   Expo Router detected them as potential routes but they had no content

### Solution Applied:

-   âœ… Removed `app/(tabs)/explore.tsx` - Empty file, not used in tab layout
-   âœ… Removed `app/(tabs)/explore2.tsx` - Empty file, not used in tab layout

### Current Active Tabs:

Based on `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`, the following tabs are properly configured:

-   âœ… `index.tsx` - Home tab
-   âœ… `search.tsx` - Search tab
-   âœ… `add.tsx` - Add item tab
-   âœ… `matches.tsx` - Matches tab
-   âœ… `feedback.tsx` - Feedback tab

## ðŸŽ‰ Result

Your Expo React Native app should now run without the route warnings!

### Expected Output:

```
Android Bundled 3661ms node_modules\expo-router\entry.js (1652 modules)
âœ… No more route warnings
```

### Next Steps:

Your app should now be running cleanly with:

-   âœ… All Expo packages updated to compatible versions
-   âœ… NativeWind/Tailwind CSS properly configured
-   âœ… TypeScript configuration fixed
-   âœ… No route export warnings
-   âœ… All tab routes properly implemented

Your **Lost Matcher** React Native app is now fully configured and ready for development! ðŸš€

# Notification Real-Time Updates - Implementation Guide

## âœ… **Real-Time Notification Count Updates**

The notification system has been upgraded to provide **real-time updates** across all screens using React Context.

### **ðŸ”„ How It Works:**

1. **Shared State**: All screens now use the same `NotificationContext` for notification data
2. **Automatic Updates**: When a notification is marked as read, the count updates instantly everywhere
3. **Context Provider**: The entire app is wrapped with `NotificationProvider` in `_layout.tsx`

### **ðŸ“± User Experience:**

#### **Before (Old Behavior):**

-   Home screen: Shows notification count = 5 (hardcoded)
-   User goes to notifications screen
-   User reads a notification
-   User returns to home screen: Still shows 5 (no update)

#### **After (New Behavior):**

-   Home screen: Shows notification count = 3 (actual unread count)
-   User goes to notifications screen
-   User taps an unread notification â†’ **Count instantly becomes 2**
-   User returns to home screen: Shows 2 (real-time sync!)

### **ðŸš€ Real-Time Update Triggers:**

1. **Tapping Notification**: Automatically marks as read + updates count
2. **Mark All Read**: Button instantly sets count to 0
3. **Delete All**: Button instantly sets count to 0
4. **New Notifications**: When added, count increases immediately

### **ðŸ§° Technical Implementation:**

```typescript
// Context provides shared state across all components
const { unreadCount, markAsRead } = useNotifications();

// Home screen automatically shows current count
<HeaderNW notificationCount={unreadCount} />;

// When notification is tapped, it auto-marks as read
// This triggers re-render everywhere that uses unreadCount
```

### **ðŸŽ¯ Key Benefits:**

-   âœ… **Instant feedback** - Users see changes immediately
-   âœ… **Consistent data** - All screens show the same count
-   âœ… **No manual refresh** required
-   âœ… **Production ready** - Easy to connect to real API
-   âœ… **TypeScript safe** - Full type checking

### **ðŸ”§ Files Changed:**

-   `contexts/NotificationContext.tsx` - New shared context
-   `app/_layout.tsx` - Added NotificationProvider wrapper
-   `screens/HomeScreenNW.tsx` - Uses context instead of hook
-   `app/notifications.tsx` - Uses context for shared state
-   `hooks/useNotifications.ts` - Removed (replaced by context)

The notification count will now update **instantly** when users interact with notifications! ðŸŽ‰

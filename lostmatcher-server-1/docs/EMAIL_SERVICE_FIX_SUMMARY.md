# Email Service Connection Fix Summary

## Issue

The email service was failing to initialize with the error:

```
Failed to initialize match notification email service: Error: Connection closed
```

## Root Cause

The email service configuration in `matchNotification.service.ts` was hardcoded to use:

-   Port 587 (non-secure)
-   `secure: false`

However, the `.env` file was configured for:

-   Port 465 (secure)
-   Gmail service

This mismatch caused the SMTP connection to fail.

## Solution

Updated `src/services/matchNotification.service.ts` to:

1. **Read SMTP configuration from environment variables:**

    ```typescript
    const smtpPort = parseInt(process.env.SMTP_PORT || "587");
    const isSecure = process.env.SMTP_SECURE === "true" || smtpPort === 465;
    ```

2. **Use proper Gmail service configuration:**

    ```typescript
    this.transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
    	host: process.env.SMTP_HOST || "smtp.gmail.com",
    	port: smtpPort,
    	secure: isSecure, // Auto-detect based on port and env var
    	service: process.env.SMTP_SERVICE || undefined, // Use 'gmail' if specified
    	auth: {
    		user: process.env.SMTP_USERNAME,
    		pass: process.env.SMTP_PASSWORD,
    	},
    	tls: {
    		rejectUnauthorized: false,
    	},
    });
    ```

3. **Updated FROM email field:**
    ```typescript
    from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM ||
    	process.env.SMTP_FROM_EMAIL ||
    	"noreply@lostmatcher.com";
    ```

## Environment Variables Used

The service now properly reads these environment variables:

-   `SMTP_HOST` - SMTP server hostname
-   `SMTP_SERVICE` - Service name (e.g., 'gmail')
-   `SMTP_PORT` - SMTP port (465 for secure, 587 for non-secure)
-   `SMTP_SECURE` - Whether to use secure connection (true/false)
-   `SMTP_USERNAME` - SMTP username
-   `SMTP_PASSWORD` - SMTP password (App Password for Gmail)
-   `EMAIL_FROM` - From email address

## Testing Result

After the fix, the server logs show:

```
[02/07/2025 13:51:06] [INFO] [Function] Match notification email service initialized successfully
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ Email service now initializes properly
2. ✅ Supports both secure (465) and non-secure (587) SMTP connections
3. ✅ Flexible configuration via environment variables
4. ✅ Graceful fallback when email credentials are missing
5. ✅ In-app and real-time notifications continue to work even if email fails

## Next Steps

-   Email notifications will now work for match alerts
-   Users will receive email notifications when potential matches are found
-   The system remains robust with fallbacks to in-app and real-time notifications
